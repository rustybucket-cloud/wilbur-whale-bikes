        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Wilbur Whale Bike Shop was founded in Provo, Ut in 2020. Our founder and owner, Jake, has been an avid cyclist for many years. Being from a rural town in Northern Arizona, there was not much to do but enjoy nature. He discovered his love for biking in his teen years, when he was gifted a mountain bike, which he used until he  destroyed it while crashing it into a tree.</p>
        <p>When Jake moved to Utah, he saw the beauty of the surrounding mountains and <a href = "https://www.traillink.com/stateactivity/ut-bike-trails/" target = "_blank">many opportunities to explore</a> on his bicycle. He found so much joy and beauty around him, that he was determined to share it with others. So he decided to create a place that could help others have the resources and knowledge to enjoy it like he did.</p>
        <p>After many hours and a lot of hard work, Wilbur Whale Bike Shop was born. We've learned and grown, and we've here to bring you the best biking experience possible. <br> You can find us at </p>
        <address>123 Main st, Provo, Ut, 84601</address>
