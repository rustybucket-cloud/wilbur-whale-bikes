        <h2>Inspecting Your Bike</h2>
        <p>It's important to make sure that your bike is functioning and handling properly to assure a fun, safe bike ride. Before you head out on your adventure check the ABC's of bicycles.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>A-Air:</strong></dt>
                <dd>Make sure that your tires are aired up. Check the air pressure before riding, bring a pump with you just in case you lose some air pressure during your ride, and bring materials needed to <a href = "#flat-repair">change your tube</a>, just in case.</dd>
            <dt><strong>B-Brakes:</strong></dt>
                <dd>Squeeze your front and back brake levers to make sure that they engage and release properly. Unexpected brake problems could be dangerous.</dd>
            <dt><strong>C-Chain:</strong></dt>
                <dd>Look at your chain and gears. Make sure that your chain is lubricated and clean. This will make sure that your chain and drivetrain last longer and ride more smoothly.</dd>
        </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Greasing Your Chain</h2>
        <p>Without proper lubrication, your smooth ride will come to a screaching halt. A dry chain will make a deafaning screetch and won't properly shift. If left unattended, the chain will rust and could snap midride, which would not be a pleasant experience.</p>
        <ul id = "chain">
            <li><strong>Clean the chain:</strong> Soak a clean rag with a degreaser. Grab the chain with the rag and backpedal to remove grime and dirt.</li>
            <li><Strong>Dry:</Strong> Dry the chain with a clean rag and perform the same motion used to clean the chain.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply lubrication:</strong> Apply a drop of chain lube on the top of each link of the chain and slowly backpedal for a few revolutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Wipe off excess lube.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Repairing a Flat Tire</h2>
        <p>Flat tires can occur at any time, while you're crusing around or while the bike is just sitting in storage. Getting stranded mid-ride is no-fun, so it's important to know this skill.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Remove the wheel:</strong> Lift up on the hook in the center of the wheel and rotate to loosen the wheel then lift up and remove.</li>
            <li><strong>Remove the tire:</strong> The tire consists of two parts, the outer casing and the inner tube. We want to get to the tube so we can fix the flat. Deflate the tire using a pump. Using a bike tire lever, pull the casing up and off the rim of the wheel, then pull the casing all the off once the casing is detached.</li>
            <li><strong>Find the hole in the tube: </strong>Listen for air leaking out of the tube and feel for the exact spot where air is leaking. You can also find the leak by putting the tube in water and look for bubbles coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li><strong>Patch the leak: </strong>Using the sander in your flat tire kit, sand down the area of the leak to flatten it. Apply the glue over the leak, and place the patch over it. Hold down for a minute, then allow for several minutes so that the glue can properly dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Put the tire back on the wheel: </strong>Put the tube back in the outer casing, making sure that the tube is not twisted. Place the casing on the wheel and tuck it into the wheel. Pump the tire back up to 80-130 psi, depedning on your tire size.</li>
            <li><strong>Place the wheel back on the bike: </strong>Place the wheel's pegs back on the bike. If you have a bike with disc breaks, make sure that the discs are ligned up correctly. Tighten the wheel by rotating and push the hook down.</li>
            <li>If your tube is beyond repair, you'll have to just <a href = "https://bicyclewarehouse.com/collections/tubes" target = "_blank">get a new one</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Adjusting Break Pads</h2>
        <p>Break pads can sometimes rub up against your wheel and make it hard to pedal. An occasional adjustment is good for your breaks to make sure that they're in the right place.</p>
        <ul id = "break-pads">
            <li><strong>Loosen the bolts: </strong>Use an Allen wrench. Turn it counterclockwise to loosen. Don't loosen the bolts all the way or the brake pads will come out of place.</li>
            <li><strong>Move the break pads: </strong>The pads should easily move. Move the pads up or down to center them.</li>
            <li><strong>Re-tightern the bolts: </strong>Use your Allen wrench and turn it clockwise until the bolts are fully tightened. Make sure that the brake pads are still centered.</li>
            <li><strong>Check the brakes: </strong> Squeese the brakes and rotate the wheel to make sure that the brakes are properly aligned and not impeding wheel rotation.</li>
        </ul>
